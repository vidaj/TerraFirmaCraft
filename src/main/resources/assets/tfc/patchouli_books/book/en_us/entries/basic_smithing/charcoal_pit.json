You will want to dig a small hole in the ground, and fill it with log piles (each with 16 logs, to maximize output). Then, cover the piles with a solid block (dirt works best). Then, remove one covering block to expose a log pile, and drop a $(item)torch$() on it. Wait a few seconds until it lights, then cover the exposed log pile and wait. After, you can dig the charcoal that's left with a shovel."
